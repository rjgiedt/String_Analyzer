# String like network analyzer

## Project overview
This project was conducted as part of consulting work for a startup company. While details of the project itself are subject to an NDA, overall this script can be utilized to quantify and understand the networking and shapes of complex interconnected structures or images with a simple single number output. Useful applications include a diverse set of biological questions, including for example, mitochondrial networks or interconnectivity of cell types.

## Code 
The code included here is designed to take in a single image and output a numerical score. Suppressed features including the segmented image itself can be pulled from the analysis with a simple imshow call. Similarly, the script can be altered to run on a large grouping of images with a simple adaptation.
